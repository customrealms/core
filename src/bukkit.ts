			 * nested permission definition (just as another permission).
			 * Using a nested definition treats the child as a positive

			 * A nested permission definition must be a map of these same

			 * A nested permission may carry it's own nested permissions
			 * as children, as they may also have nested permissions, and
			 * so forth. There is no direct limit to how deep the

			 * As a list:
			 * children: [inferno.flagrate, inferno.burningdeaths]
